# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The my-personal-pocs project contains multiple modules with different technology stacks and integration patterns. As the project grows and evolves, it's important to document the architectural decisions that were made to provide context for future development and maintenance.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions made during the development of this project. Each ADR will be a markdown file in the `adr/` directory with a sequential number and descriptive name.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Documentation**: Future developers will understand why certain decisions were made
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Architectural context is preserved even if team members change
- **Learning**: ADRs serve as learning material for understanding the project's evolution
- **Consistency**: Provides a structured approach to documenting architectural decisions

### Negative

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires discipline to create and maintain ADRs
- **Potential Outdated Information**: ADRs may become outdated if not regularly reviewed

## Template

Future ADRs should follow this template:

```markdown
